## Setup

Before any signing interactions between the **Axon Ivy Engine** and the **A-Trust Handy Signatur** services can be run, they have to be introduced to each other. This can be done as follows:

1. Register an A-Trust Handy-Signatur account: https://www.a-trust.at/en/handy-signatur/handy-signatur-activation/

2. Create an A-Trust Signatur-Box and get a new open API key: https://www.a-trust.at/en/handy-signatur/signaturbox/

3. Open the `Definitions/Web Service Clients` Editor in your Designer and select `ATrustHandysignaturService` client.

4. Edit the web service `WSDL URL` to your ***Signatur-box*** endpoint:

   ![atrust-wsdl-url](doc/images/edit-web-service-client.png)

5. Scroll to **Features** add `IgnoreAllPoliciesFeature` and `WSAddressingFeature`

   ![atrust-service-feature](doc/images/edit-web-service-feature.png)

6. Click on the `Generate WS classes` button, then save and close `Web Service Clients`. Make sure your endpoint URL is generated correctly.

7. Open the `Configuration/variables.yaml` in your Designer and edit `APIKey`, `ATrustTemplateId`

   ![atrust-key](doc/images/edit-atrust-variable.png)

8. Save the changed settings.

9. Start `ATrustIntegration/DemoStart/StartATrustExample.ivp` of the `atrust-connector-demo` project to test your setup.

      Your setup was correct if you are being forwarded to the ***[A-Trust identification](https://www.handy-signatur.at/mobile/https-security-layer-request/identification.aspx)*** page.

### Notes:

The DemoStart process contains a final service part, where we prepared a signature template on the A-Trust server.

   ![atrust-demo-feature](doc/images/atrust-demo-feature.png)

* You need to upload a signature template and update `ATrustTemplateId` value in the `Configuration/variables.yaml`.
* An example SignatureTemplate in CMS: `cms/Templates/tempsiegel1`.
* Upload template process available in `DemoStart.mod` process of `atrust-connector-demo` project. A-trust returns `templateID` and sets it in project Variables!
* **Handy Signatur** is probably only possible for **AUSTRIANS**.
* Check the latest API description on the **[A-Trust](https://www.a-trust.at)** webpage.
