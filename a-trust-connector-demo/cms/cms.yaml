              AdditionalHints: The x and y coordinates define a corner of the signature image. It should be noted that the coordinate origin is in the lower-left corner of the PDF file. W and h define the image's second corner. These coordinates are expressed as percentages (page height/page width). The
                page onto which the signature image is to be placed has to be defined as well. If you entered one of them, you must complete all, otherwise, it will use default.
