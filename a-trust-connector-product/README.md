## Setup

Before any signing interactions between the **Axon Ivy Engine** and the **A-Trust HandySignatur** services can be run, they have to be introduced to each other. This can be done as follows:

1. Register an **A-Trust HandySignatur** account: https://www.a-trust.at/en/handy-signatur/handy-signatur-activation/

3. Open the `Configuration/variables.yaml` in your Designer and paste the below code with your `APIKey`, `TemplateId`, `EndpointUri`

   ```
   Variables:
     # Custom variables of ATrust Handysignatur API
     ATrust:
       # API Key for "A-Trust Handysignatur API"
       APIKey: 'your API Key'

       # The endpoint uri of A-Trust Handysignatur Signatur-box webservice
       EndpointUri: 'your Endpoint URI'

       # The ID of the signature template to be used.
       TemplateId: # your TemplateId with number format, e.g: 1

   ```
