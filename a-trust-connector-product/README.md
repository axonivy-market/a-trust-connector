3. Open the `Configuration/variables.yaml` in your Designer and paste the below code with your `APIKey`, `TemplateId`, `EndpointUri`

   ```
   Variables:
     # Custom variables of ATrust Handysignatur API
     ATrust:
       # API Key for "A-Trust Handysignatur API"
       APIKey: 'your API Key'

       # The endpoint uri of A-Trust Handysignatur Signatur-box webservice
       EndpointUri: 'your Endpoint URI'

       # The ID of the signature template to be used.
       TemplateId: # your TemplateId with number format, e.g: 1
